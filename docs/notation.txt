The goal of board state notation is to uniquely describe a board state, in a format that is cheap to encode/decode
Board state notation should also allow for variable piece counts, with any number of digits

To denote a winning state, tile state is not recorded, and only "W*" or "B*" are used to denote the winner

For now, notation is being encoded in a string with the following order:

Tile state (going left to right, then top to bottom, 20 total characters), with text 'W', 'B', or '-'
hash separator "#"
Count of unplayed white pieces
hash separator "#"
Count of scored white pieces
hash separator "#"
Count of unplayed black pieces
hash separator "#"
Count of scored black pieces
hash separator "#"
Current player turn, 'W' or 'B'
